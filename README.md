## Executive Summary

We were asked to create a preditive model for civil rights cases and included in predicting. 

**Overall we created two models to predict the following cases:** 

The first one is we wanted to predict the probability of if a case was closed due to a Summary Judegment.
The second one is that we wanted to predict the probability of if a case was closed due by a Settlement

These cases were civil rights related cases and included a number of data variables including the type of 
demographics at each of the locations where the case was handled.


**We also looked at a number of other related cases which included of the questions we looked at included:**

1. Identify districts that have a high (or low) filing rate
2. Identify demographic features of a district that could be used to distinguish districts with a high filing rate from districts with a low filing rate? 
3. Which court venues are more (or less) sympathetic to a filer’s motion to dismiss?
4. Which court venues are more (or less) sympathetic to a filer’s motion for summary judgement?  
5. Do certain court venues tend to favor the plaintiffs/defendants? 
6. Identify characteristics of a case that appear to be indicative of a case’s outcome
7. Investigate any relationships that may exist between the outcome of a case and the various terminating motions that are made 
8. Investigate any relationships that may exist between the outcome of a case and the various non-terminating motions that are made  
9. Identify any relationships that may exist between the outcome of a case and whether or not a non-terminating motion is granted/denied
